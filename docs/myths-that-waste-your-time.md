> "A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still lacing up its boots." - Mark Twain

            We live in the most connected age in history, yet many people still believe things about fat loss that are simply not true. Why?

            Because myths are simple, seductive, and feel good.
            Truth is often slower, quieter, and requires nuance.

            But if you want results that last, you must stop wasting energy on false paths.

        ## Myth #1: "Carbs make you fat."

          Carbs are **not the enemy**. Excess energy is.

          - The **only** way to gain fat is to consistently eat more energy than you burn.

          - You can gain fat eating only "clean" foods, and lose fat eating carbs, if energy balance is managed.

          Low-carb diets *can* help some people reduce calories, but **it's the deficit, not the carbs**, doing the work.

        > The NHS states clearly:
            "There's no need to cut out carbohydrates to lose weight."

        ## Myth #2: "You have to do cardio to lose fat."

          Cardio is helpful, but **not essential**.

          Fat loss is about a calorie deficit, not about any specific movement.

          - You can walk, lift, do yoga, or simply move more during the day.

          - Resistance training helps **preserve muscle**, which is more important during weight loss.

        > CDC recommends both cardio and strength for health, not just fat loss.

        ## Myth #3: "You need supplements to lose weight."

          No supplement burns fat magically.

          Some may help slightly (like caffeine or green tea extract), but:

          - None work without a deficit.

          - Most are overpriced.

          - A healthy, whole-food-based diet provides what you need.

          Spend your money on good food, not magic powders.
