      ## The Problem With Goals Alone

Everyone sets goals:

        - “Lose 10 lbs.”

        - “Work out 4x a week.”

        - “No sugar for 30 days.”

These are fine... **until life happens.**

The goal loses urgency. Your kid gets sick. You miss a few workouts. Motivation fades.

Why?

### Focus on Outcomes, Not Identity

} theme="red">
        Because goals focus on outcomes, not identity.

          A goal says: “I want to run a marathon.”
          An identity says: “I’m the kind of person who trains, even on hard days.”

---

      ## Identity Is the Deep Root

Identity shapes action more consistently than motivation ever will.

### How Identity Works

} theme="purple">
        It works like this:

          Belief: “I am the kind of person who…”
          Action: Small daily behaviors align with that belief
          Evidence: Each action reinforces the identity

        Over time, it becomes who you are, not something you “try to do.”

      ## Example: The Meal Logger

Short-term goal: “Log my meals every day for 30 days.”

Great. But...

### Better: Identity-Based Meal Logging

} theme="green">
        Better: “I’m the kind of person who checks in with myself through my meals.”
        Now, even if you miss a day, you’re not “off-track.” You’re simply returning to your identity.

      ## Habits That Shape Identity

The goal isn’t to be perfect.

The goal is to **repeat the story** you want to believe about yourself, often enough that it sticks.

---

      ## When You Slip

Everyone slips. You will too.

### Your Compass, Not a Cage

} theme="blue">
        The key is to ask:
        “Is this who I am becoming?”

          If yes, keep going.
          If not, return gently to alignment.

        Identity isn’t rigid. It’s a compass, not a cage.

### Rhythm, Not Hype

} theme="green">
        It’s not about hacking your way to quick wins.
        It’s about living into a version of you that feels real, grounded, and durable.
        You don’t need hype.
        You need rhythm.

          "Discipline is choosing who you want to become over and over, until it feels like home."
