      ## What Is a Plateau?

A **plateau** is when your progress slows or stalls for a stretch, even though you’re still putting in effort.

Common signs:

        - Scale doesn’t move for 2-4 weeks

        - Clothes fit the same

        - Youre doing “everything right,” but nothing seems to change

It’s frustrating. But it’s not failure. It’s **biology.**

      ## Why Plateaus Happen (Biologically & Behaviorally)
      ###  Adaptive Thermogenesis

Your body *reduces energy output* when it senses weight loss, to protect against starvation (even when you’re not starving).

      ###  Less Body = Less Burn

When you lose weight, your body becomes smaller, meaning it burns fewer calories doing the same things.

      ###  You May Be Eating More Than You Think

Small bites, extra tastes, or "harmless" snacks can slowly tilt the balance.

      ###  Sleep, Stress, and Recovery

Poor sleep or chronic stress raises cortisol, which may increase hunger and reduce recovery.

      ## What Not to Do

### Avoid These Reactive Responses

} theme="red">

          Slash calories hard
          Double workouts
          Blame your body
          Quit altogether

        These are reactive responses, and they almost always backfire.
        Instead, respond with calm and clarity.

      ## What To Do Instead

Here’s a framework that works, built on *principles*, not panic.

### 1. Check the Basics

} theme="green">

          Are you logging meals honestly?
          Are portions gradually increasing?
          Are you still getting protein at each meal?
          Have sleep/stress/movement dropped?

          "Return to what worked when you started. Don’t “add more”, realign."

### 2. Use a “Hold Phase”

} theme="blue">
        Give your body 1-2 weeks at maintenance:

          Eat slightly more (especially carbs and fiber)
          Reduce training intensity
          Sleep more, stress less

        Why? Your metabolism may “reset” slightly, and youll restore mood, recovery, and motivation.

          "Sometimes the best way forward is to pause, not push."

### 3. Adjust Gently

        If the plateau lasts 3+ weeks, consider one tweak at a time:

        No big overhauls. Just one dial at a time.

      ## Remember This

Plateaus are not the end, they’re checkpoints.

The body is **not a machine**. It’s a living system.
It adapts, resists, rebalances. That’s *wise*, not broken.

      > "Progress isn’t always visible, but it’s always shaped by your patience."

Don’t quit 5 minutes before the breakthrough.
