        ## The Most Overlooked Fat Loss Tool: Muscle

          When people try to "lose weight," they often lose more than just fat.

          They lose **muscle mass**, the very thing that:

          - Burns energy even at rest

          - Keeps joints safe and posture upright

          - Helps you move, lift, climb, stand, and stay strong into old age

          And yet, most weight-loss programs ignore it.

          They cut calories but forget the **fuel that protects your structure**: protein.

        ## Why Protein Matters During Fat Loss

          Protein is not just a nutrient: it's a **signal**.

          When you eat enough protein:

          - Your body holds on to muscle (even in a calorie deficit)

          - You feel full longer, reducing cravings

          - Your recovery from movement improves

          - Your metabolism stays higher: muscle burns more than fat at rest

        > Protein tells your body: "Preserve strength while we lose fat."

          Without enough protein, especially when reducing calories, the body breaks down muscle for energy.

          That's like selling your house brick by brick to save on rent.

        ## How Much Protein Do You Actually Need?

          Here's what science-backed ranges say:

### Protein Requirements for Fat Loss

}>

            For most adults aiming to lose fat and preserve muscle, a protein intake higher than the standard recommended daily allowance can be beneficial. General guidelines suggest:

              1.0–1.6g of protein per kg of bodyweight
              (or ~0.45–0.7g per lb of bodyweight)

              More active individuals or those aiming for maximal muscle retention may benefit from the higher end of this range, or slightly above.

              These recommendations align with research indicating that increased protein intake supports muscle preservation and satiety during weight loss.

                Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health: How Much Protein Do You Need?

                Harvard Health: Are You Eating Enough Protein?

                PubMed Central: Higher Dietary Protein Diets in Weight Loss (Review)

          So if you weigh 70kg (154 lbs), that's around **70–112g of protein per day**.

          That might sound like a lot — but spread across 3–4 meals, it becomes simple:

          - Breakfast: 25g

          - Lunch: 35g

          - Snack: 20g

          - Dinner: 35g

          Even hitting **80–100g** will do more for fat loss than most people realize.

        ## Muscle Is Metabolic Insurance

        > Muscle is your body's retirement savings.
            It makes future fat gain less likely, and weight regain less rapid.

            People with more lean mass tend to maintain weight loss more easily, even with the same calories.

            Why? Because:

            Muscle burns more calories at rest than fat
            You perform better in daily movement = higher NEAT
            Recovery, joint health, and hormone balance improve with resistance training

        ## But I Don't Want to "Bulk Up"…

        > You won't.

            Especially if you're in a calorie deficit and not lifting like an Olympian.

              Gaining visible muscle takes years of training and food surplus.
              Preserving muscle is about staying functional, strong, and lean.

            This is especially vital if you're:

            Over 40
            Peri/post-menopausal
            Recovering from injury
            Prone to yo-yo dieting

        ## Practical Protein: What to Eat

          Here are go-to protein sources across diets:

### Animal-Based

Chicken breast (30g per 100g)
            Eggs (6g per egg)
            Greek yogurt (10g per 100g)
            Cottage cheese
            Fish (tuna, salmon, cod)

### Plant-Based

Lentils, chickpeas, beans
            Tofu, tempeh
            Seitan
            Soy milk
            Plant-based protein powders

### Supplements (Optional)

}>

            Whey or vegan protein shakes
            Ideal for post-workout or to fill protein gaps without extra calories

        ## Where Getter Fits In

          Most people underestimate or overestimate their protein.

        ## Build a Plate, Preserve Your Strength

        > When building meals, start with protein, not sides. Try:

            "What's my protein?" before asking "What else?"

            A meal built around protein is a meal built to last.

        ## What You Can Do This Week

### Add protein to breakfast

}>

              Most people skip it. Try eggs, Greek yogurt, or a shake.

### Double-check meals for a protein anchor

}>

              Even plant-based meals should feature a clear protein source.

### Move a little with purpose

}>

              Even 2x/week resistance training (pushups, squats, bands) helps preserve lean mass.

        ## Muscle is the Goal, Not Just Weight Loss

          Fat loss without strength is like saving money but losing your tools.

          **Protein + movement = long-term insurance against regain.**

          Not flashy. Not extreme. But *foundational*.

        > Build muscle like it's your safety net, because it is.
