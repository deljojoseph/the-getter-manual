      ## Arrival Is Not the End

        You did it.
        You lost the weight. You feel stronger, clearer, lighter.

        But then... a strange fog sets in.

        You think:

        - “What now?”

        - “Do I still track?”

        - “Will I gain it back?”

        This is normal. Because **maintenance is not a finish line**: it’s a *new identity to live into*.

      ## The Trap: “Now I Can Relax”

        Many fall into the “goal done, discipline off” loop.
        They:

        - Stop checking in

        - Over-reward with old habits

        - Lose the rhythm that brought them here

      > Weight loss habits built with pressure will collapse without it.

        That’s why we shift from **pressure** to **principle**.

      ## The Mindset Shift

        In fat loss mode, the question is:

      > “How do I change?”

        In maintenance mode, it becomes:

      > “How do I protect what I’ve built with care?”

        This requires:

        - A *slower pace*, but not no pace

        - *Autopilot systems*, but not disengagement

        - *Trust in your defaults*, not obsession over outcomes

          Review, don’t obsessCheck in weekly, not hourly. Use Getter like a mirror, not a microscope.
          Keep protein and fiber highThese are your satiety allies. Meals should still “hold you” for hours.
          Anchor your dayOne grounding ritual: a walk, a log, a quiet moment with your food.
          Build “return points”Travel? Holidays? Life disruptions? Always have a default you return to.
          Let weight fluctuate without panicSmall ups and downs are normal. Track patterns, not panic points.

      ## From Losing to Living

        You didn’t come this far to stay in hustle mode.

        You came to **rebuild your normal.**

        This is the quiet power of maintenance:

        - Less dramatic

        - More grounded

        - Deeper peace

      > You don’t have to fight for it forever, if you live like the version of you who already owns it.

        Welcome home.
