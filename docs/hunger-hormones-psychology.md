        ## The Three Faces of Hunger

          - **Physical Hunger**: a gradual, gnawing emptiness that any balanced meal can satisfy.

          - **Emotional Hunger**: a sudden, specific urge (usually for sugar, salt, or fat) tied to mood, stress, or habit.

          - **Environmental Hunger**: cravings triggered by smells, screens, social events, or the simple sight of food.

        ## The Hormones Running the Show

**Rises with:** An empty stomach, dieting, or lack of sleep.

**Effect:** Signals hunger to the brain. It's the "go" signal for eating.

**Rises with:** Adequate fat stores and balanced sleep.

**Effect:** Signals fullness (satiety) to the brain. It's the "stop" signal.

**Rises with:** After carb-rich meals.

**Effect:** Regulates blood sugar. Roller-coaster spikes can prompt cravings.

**Rises with:** Stress and sleep debt.

**Effect:** Drives comfort-eating, especially for high-energy foods.

          Poor sleep, chronic stress, and restrictive dieting **tilt** these hormones toward constant cravings.

        ## Why Cravings Feel Psychological (They Are)

        > Dopamine Loops: Novel or hyper-palatable foods light up reward pathways, teaching the brain: Do that again.
            Comfort Conditioning: Early memories of treats = fast relief, so the brain seeks that fix when emotions spike.
            Decision Fatigue: The more choices you fight all day, the weaker your "no" muscle becomes at night.

            Hunger is felt in the stomach; cravings are remembered in the brain.

        ## Tools to Tame the Trio

When the urge hits, rate hunger 1-10 and **name the feeling** (stress, boredom, joy). Labeling emotion calms the amygdala which helps drop craving intensity.

A meal anchored in protein and veggies blunts ghrelin and stabilises insulin for hours.

Two-minute diaphragmatic breathing or a short walk lowers cortisol quickly, often dissolving the "need" to snack.

Simple rules reduce decision fatigue:

            - "Dessert only if I've hit my protein goal."

            - "Snacks live in one cupboard; I sit at the table to eat them."

        ## What You Can Do This Week

**Mon:** Add 20g protein to breakfast to flatten mid-morning cravings.

**Wed:** 2-min box-breathing after work to lower cortisol before dinner.

**Fri:** Single "mindful treat" ritual to practice presence over binging.

**Weekend:** 10k steps split over both days to raise leptin sensitivity and improve mood.

        ## Hunger Is Information, Not an Enemy

        > If you listen to hunger, it guides you to balance.
            If you fight it, it fights back, harder.

            Treat cravings like waves: observe, breathe, ride, or step aside. The ocean calms sooner than you think.
